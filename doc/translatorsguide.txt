Guide for translators
=====================

Libquicktime's string translation is a pretty straighforward
gettextization. Consult the gettext documentation for in-depth
info.

Here some quick instuction for adding support for a new language xy:

1. Everything important is in the subdirectory po

2. Go there and type

   msginit -l xy

   If you are asked for an email address (for language-specific bugreports), 
   either enter your own address or (of you are afraid of getting spam),
   subscribe to libquicktime-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and enter that one.
   After that, go to the toplevel directory and run autogen.sh followed by
   configure.

3. The created language file is named xy.po, it's the file you gonna
   translate. The file structure is pretty simple, entries look like this:

   #: src/lqt_quicktime.c:112
   msgid "quicktime_make_streamable: no moov atom"
   msgstr ""

   msgid is the identifier of the message, which is, in turn, the English
   string. If a string doesn't need a translation, just leave the msgstr
   empty (gettext will return the untranslated string if no tranlation was found).

4. For testing the translation you need to run autogen.sh (in the toplevel
   directory) once after the language was initialized. For updating the translation,
   go to the po/ directory and type:

   make update-gmo
   make install

5. If you find some spelling error in the English strings (not unlikely), please
   make a patch for the source files as well
